# Convex Optimization Cookbook

Unless otherwise stated, we will assume that quadratic coefficient matrices
(e.g., $Q$) are positive semi-definite so that $x^\top Q x$ is a convex
function.

## Positive definite, unconstrained optimization

If $\Q$ is positive definite then problems of the form:

$$ \min_x Â½ x^\top Q x + x \ell $$
